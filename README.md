## What is JANNLab?

JANNLab is a Java framework for modeling, simulating and application of artificial neural networks. It supports feed forward networks, recurrent networks as well as Long Short-Term Memory networks and bidirectional architectures. The framework provides free modeling but also real-time efficiency. It is compatible with android and is
light-weight, which makes it suitable for mobile device implementations.
